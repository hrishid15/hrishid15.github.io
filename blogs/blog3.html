            <p>
                My dad recently sent a video into our family group chat, as most dads do when they find something that they believe is so profound or interesting 
                that they have to share it with everyone. Usually, I tend to neglect these videos (sorry Dad if you’re reading this) because I’m not always 
                interested in “Why the World Feels More Hateful & Distrustful” or “The World’s Nicest Motorhome” — which, by the way, are real articles he has 
                sent us before. This time, however, in a rare moment of filial duty, I decided to watch the video, which turned out to be a debate between an 
                atheist and a religious scholar regarding the existence of God (or a ‘supernatural power’, whatever floats your boat). About 15 minutes into 
                this debate, the atheist asked the scholar a question: what is the difference between faith and belief? It was at this point that I paused the 
                video in confusion, as I’d always thought both of those were the same thing. We toss around the phrases “have faith” and “just believe” so easily 
                these days that I’d never thought to consider how faith and belief could actually be two different concepts. Instead of continuing to watch 
                (which would have probably given me some answers) I decided to take my own shot at deciphering the difference between them. After a lot of 
                pondering and several conversations with my dad, I was able to come to a conclusion that I think is pretty satisfying.
            </p>

            <h2>What's the Difference?</h2>

            <p>
                Imagine standing in front of a bridge that you’ve never crossed before. Engineers have certified this bridge as structurally sound, lots of other 
                people cross it daily without issue, and overall it looks solid. Based on all this evidence, you believe that the bridge is safe — accepting the idea 
                that the bridge is safe to be a fact. But having faith in that bridge is something else entirely. Faith is actually walking across it. It's putting 
                your weight on it, trusting it with your safety, committing to the act of crossing despite any lingering uncertainty. That's the initial 
                distinction: belief is intellectual acceptance ("this bridge is safe"), while faith is active commitment ("I'm walking across it").
            </p>

            <p>
                At first glance, this makes faith seem dependent on belief. After all, you develop faith in the bridge based on your beliefs about its structural 
                integrity. Belief comes first, then faith follows as a natural consequence. But here's where it gets more complicated: faith can also work in 
                reverse, generating belief even when the evidence points the other way. Consider a parent whose child has gone missing. As time passes, the 
                evidence increasingly suggests the worst. Every rational indicator says the child is gone. Yet the parent insists, "I have faith my child is 
                alive and well." In this case, the parent isn't arriving at faith through belief — they don't believe their child is fine simply based on the 
                evidence. Instead, their faith — their refusal to give up and their commitment to hope — is actually creating belief. The act of maintaining 
                faith generates a conviction that defies the facts in front of them. So we now know that faith and belief can flow in both directions. 
                Sometimes belief enables faith (the bridge). Sometimes faith generates belief (the parent). They're not the same thing, but rather interconnected 
                components of something larger.
            </p>

            <h3>Dependence on Possibility</h3>

            <p>
                Another small nuance about faith that I discovered is that it actually has a boundary condition — it requires openness to possibility. 
                Consider a person who claims, “I don't believe in an afterlife. I think when you die, that's it. But I have faith that I'll see my loved 
                ones again after death.” This definitely seems contradictory, and it is. Although this individual claims to not believe in an afterlife, 
                having faith that they will see their loved ones after death shows that a part of this person is open to the possibility that there could 
                be an afterlife. This possibility that our person houses is what allows them to have that faith in the first place. As a side note, this 
                also shows how humans don’t necessarily have set beliefs, and our claims about our beliefs don’t always align with our actual thoughts. 
                To an extent, we always consider both sides of a dilemma, even when we have a clear favorite.
            </p>

            <h3>Circling Back</h3>

            <p>
                We now understand that belief is accepting something as true cognitively or intellectually, while faith is a form of commitment or 
                trust driven by possibility in the face of uncertainty. Tying this back to the idea of God and religion that was presented in the debate, 
                I went after what I thought was an interesting question: is it possible to believe in God but not have faith in God? Although this seems 
                contradictory, the answer is pretty simple. Choosing to believe in a supernatural power is just a cognitive action, but you don’t necessarily 
                have to commit to a religion and follow that power or that God. You are simply aware of one another with no actual connection to each other.
            </p>

            <h2>So What Now?</h2>

            <p>
                At this point you may be asking, “Why does this matter? And what is this larger idea you mentioned earlier that faith and belief are both 
                components of?” And that is pretty much exactly what I asked myself, because I did not know where I was going with this, but it still felt 
                like I was missing something. So I guess my next question to solve would be, what happens when your faith and your belief both align? 
                What’s the end product of that? My immediate answer to this was that faith and belief converge to form a fact, or truth, which is exactly 
                what led me on a tangent regarding discovery vs. invention.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Discovery vs. Invention
            </h3>

            <p>
                The discovery vs. invention debate is one of those philosophical rabbit holes that seems simple at first but gets increasingly complex the 
                deeper you go. When humans create something new — whether it's a piece of technology, a work of art, or a mathematical theorem — are we 
                discovering something that already existed in some abstract space of possibilities, or are we inventing something that never existed before? 
            </p>

            <p>
                Consider Beethoven's Fifth Symphony (I know, its a weird reach). Before Beethoven composed it, did that specific sequence of notes exist anywhere? 
                One perspective, Constructivism, supports that Beethoven created something brand new, bringing a piece of art that had never been there before into 
                existence.  The other perspective, Platonism, argues that all possible sequences of musical notes already exist in mathematical and logical space. 
                Therefore, Beethoven didn't create anything, but rather he just found a particularly beautiful arrangement that was always there, waiting to be 
                discovered. Both of these views have merit, but there's something unsatisfying about both extremes of this dilemma. If everything that could 
                possibly exist already "exists" in some abstract mathematical or logical space, doesn't that make the word "exist" basically meaningless? 
            </p>

            <div class="callout">
                <div class="callout-title">Platonism vs. Constructivism</div>
                <p style="margin: 0;">
                    Platonism is the philosophical view that abstract objects, concepts, and possibilities exist independently of human minds in some eternal, unchanging realm.
                    This theory is named after Plato, who believed in a "world of Forms" where perfect versions of everything exist. Constructivism is the opposing view 
                    that knowledge, concepts, and objects are constructed or created by human minds and societies rather than discovered. Constructivists argue that 
                    things don't exist until we actively create them.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                This is where the distinction between possibility and actuality becomes really important. Maybe the right answer isn't discovery or invention, 
                but actually something in between. We definitely discover possibilities, whether those are patterns, configurations, or arrangements that could 
                theoretically exist. But then we actualize them — we bring them from the realm of abstract possibility into concrete reality. Beethoven didn't 
                just stumble upon his Fifth Symphony; he had to sit down, commit to the creative process, and transform an abstract possibility into actual music 
                that people could hear.
            </p>

            <h3>Full Circle</h3>

            <p>
                This is exactly where faith and belief come back into play. Beethoven believed in the mathematical relationships between musical notes, in the 
                patterns that could create beauty, but belief alone doesn't write a symphony. He also needed faith — the commitment to actually compose, the trust 
                in his creative process, the willingness to actualize what he could only imagine. His belief gave him a sense of what was possible, but it was his 
                faith that made it real.
            </p>

            <p>
                I think that this is the best way to describe what happens when faith and belief align: you become an agent of actualization. You take something from 
                our realm of possibility and transform it into reality. This applies for pretty much anything you could imagine — you believe a goal is possible for 
                you (it exists in the space of things you could achieve), and your faith (commitment and willingness to achieve that goal despite uncertainty) actualizes 
                it. It works for building relationships, pursuing careers, creating art, even engaging with questions of philosophy and meaning (does this count as 
                a 4th wall break?). 
            </p>

            <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

            <p>
                At this point, it definitely feels like we've deviated from the initial question from the religious debate. But in a sense, I think this deep 
                dive into faith, belief, and their relationship to actualization was fully necessary for understanding why these concepts are so significant 
                to us as humans. Faith and belief aren't just abstract philosophical topics to debate in the context of religion or spirituality. They're 
                fundamental tools that we use on a day-to-day basis to navigate uncertainty and bring new things into existence. Belief maps the territory 
                of what's possible. Faith is what gets us to actually walk the path. And when they work together, aligned in the same direction, that's what 
                allows us to shape the world.
            </p>

                If this seemed interesting to you, I would recommend watching the entire 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/2eX26jVaR_A" target="_blank" style="color: #2a2a2a; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px solid #2a2a2a;">video debate</a>. 
                I did end up finishing it later on and thought that several other interesting points and topics were brought up, but this one stood out to me the 
                most. Thanks for reading and happy holidays!
